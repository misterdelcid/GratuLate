GratuLate - An App for Delayed Appreciation

Description: GratuLate allows you to add thank you notes to send to specific contacts on specific dates or a random date within a selected timeline. Add your contact(s), create action(s) to send to your contact(s) and wait until they become current to send out your thank you message. This app was created with React, Redux, React Router, Material-UI, Styled-Components, EmailJS, and Firebase. 

This project is my most complete, cohesive project to date. It really helped reinforce my knowledge about authentication, redux, and firebase. It was also a great learning experience to try to creatively keep the design simple, minimalist, and (hopefully) pretty.

You can check out a demo of the app here: https://seen-bb21c.web.app

Thank you for taking the time to check out my code. It means a lot!
